## First Stage:

First part is done using only JS. All info is printed using console.

### Benefits:
1. Getting know how **functions** work with each other.
2. Creating simple **for** loop.

## Second Stage:

In second part main task was to create UI for the game. I decided to make UI more interesting by creating "start page" and then using JS to create all elments for the game.
UI was designed in Figma for easier visualisation.

### Benefits:
1. Getting know how to **create**, **target** and **use DOM elements**.
2. Using JS to hide, show and change elements during game and after game end.
